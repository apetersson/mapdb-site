Missing links
----------------
MapDB migrated to Jekyll and some old links no longer work. 
Here are some new links:

- [Blog](/blog)

- Documentation has moved to [Git Books](https://jankotek.gitbooks.io/mapdb/content/)

- Code examples [are in github repository](https://github.com/jankotek/mapdb-site/tree/gh-pages/src/test/java/doc)

- 1.0 and 2.0 versions are no longer maintained, here is old [PDF documentation](/down/mapdb-manual-20.pdf) and 
  [older version examples](https://github.com/jankotek/mapdb/tree/release-2.0/src/test/java/examples)

Please open [Issue on Github](http://github.com/jankotek/mapdb-site/issues) if you can not find something.
