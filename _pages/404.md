Missing links
----------------
MapDB migrated to Jekyll and some old links no longer work. 
Here are some new links:

- [Blog](/blog)

- Documentation has moved to [Git Books](https://jankotek.gitbooks.io/mapdb/content/)

- 1.0 and 2.0 versions are no longer maintained, here is old [PDF documentation](/down/mapdb-manual-20.pdf).

Please open [Issue on Github](http://github.com/jankotek/mapdb-site/issues) if you can not find something.

The page you were trying to view does not exist --- perhaps you can try searching for it below.
